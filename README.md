# Project Overview
This project explores the factors that influence individual medical insurance charges using regression models. I built and compared two models: a simple linear regression and a multivariate regression, analyzing performance and interpretability. I used R and ggplot2 for analysis and visualization, and presented my findings in a final slide deck.

## Objective
To predict insurance charges and understand how variables such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more influence medical costs.
